# Class Notes on 27 Feb 23:

- The posts will have links, titles, descriptions and an optional image.
- A post can be linked to more than one space.
- The spaces are communities that users can join, post, comment.
- Each space will have policies regarding how contributions can be made:
1. any member of the space
2. only users who have been granted posting rights,
3. only moderators.
- Owners can define the policies of the space and assign roles to members. Moderators can manage inspect and remove abusive content. Moderators can warn people who are disruptive, such as posting way too many things, or duplicates, etc.
- The system should check if the link is already posted, and see if the user still wishes to post it. Sometimes it makes sense to post the same link from different perspectives. Just give a warning.
- Users will be able to post new links. They can create two type of tags
1. descriptive via Wikidata
2. Informative (such as 'to watch', 'interesting', 'good quality', 'needs improvement', etc.)
- The users will have badges that indicate how they use the system. The idea is to recognize those
who use the system well from different perspectives.
- Users will be able to annotate the posts with text or images using the W3C Web Annotation Data
Model
- The system should make user, space, and post recommendations.
- Users must be able to search for posts and spaces according to posts, spaces, tags, and
annotations.
- Should have an admin panel page for editorial side of spaces.
- Spaces should policy page and user should be required to read it when joining to space.


## Questions:
- Annotation part?
- Link is exactly the same or just domain?
- Where to check if the link is same, space or whole database?
- How to enforce policies?
- Recommendation based on what?
- How do moderators warn disruptive users? Can we put 3 warning then block policy on the website?
- Can users message each other?
- Who will decide on which badges we will have?
- Can we use Azure?
